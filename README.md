Jason Goodwin's "Learning Akka" Book
---

This code is a work in progress following JG's Learning Akka Book. The current plan is to have each chapter as an SBT project. Ideally, you should be able to clone the repository, `cd` to a chapter, and run `sbt test`.

#### Progress
1. Chapter 1, Questions:
    - [x] Create an actor which stores the last string it received
    - [x] Write a unit test which confirms the actor will receive a message correctly
    - [x] Write a unit test which behaves correctly if it is sent two messages
2. Chapter 2 (Reading Chapter)
